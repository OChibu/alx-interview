Welcome to the Rotate 2D Matrix module. This module is designed to guide you through the implementation of a function to rotate a 2D matrix (square matrix) in-place. Rotating a matrix is a common algorithmic problem that has practical applications in image processing, graphics, and various other fields. This module covers the algorithm, its implementation, and potential optimizations.
