Welcome to the Making Change module. This module is designed to guide you through the process of solving the problem of making change using dynamic programming. Making change is a classic algorithmic problem where the goal is to determine the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount. This module covers the algorithm, its implementation, and potential optimizations.
